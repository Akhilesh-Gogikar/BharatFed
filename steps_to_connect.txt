These are the steps to be followed when onboarding a new user:

1) Register the new user here with a generated finvu id with mobile number and password and password confirmation -> https://finvu.in/webview/onboarding/webview-register
2) Save the finvu id, mobile number and password for future use
###
Just for the test data phase ensure that users data is prepopulated in the fip apis using the file test_account_create.py

providing users phone number and email id is es enough all the other details can be generated on the fly and saved to a db

###
3) Generate a consent request using an approved template via the consent_req function in the test_fiu_api.py

4) Save the consent handle received in the response

5) Login to this webpage with the saved finvu id and password-> https://finvu.in/webview/onboarding/webview-login

6) When redirected to this message relay the choices of drop down to the user -> https://finvu.in/webview/onboarding/linked-account-message

7) User links an account in a specific bank from the drop down - Bank of Baroda url : http://api.finvu.in, ICICI Bank url : https://apialt.finvu.in
Relay the choics of the user to this webpage and relay the response until the response changes and procedes to next page -> https://finvu.in/webview/onboarding/select-bank

8) The user selects the appropriate consent requests and check the box against it and selects it

9) User is requested and OTP at this point which should be entered and that OTP approves the consent for us to utilize
-> consent status can be checked using the check_consent_status function in the test_fiu_api.py and the consent id can be saved for data request

10) Once this is done we can generate data requests using the consent handle and consent id which we have stored

11) Once the data request is approved by the AA we can relay the data and relay it to the user.
